## The Problem

AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude, VS Code, ChatGPT, Windsurf, and others) connect to MCP servers that expose file systems, shell interpreters, network access, and environment variables. Static scanners tell you you're exposed — but they act after the fact. By the time a scanner flags a risky server, the agent may have already run a destructive command, exfiltrated credentials, or reached out to an untrusted endpoint.

**MCP Seatbelt adds a runtime enforcement layer.** It acts as a policy proxy between the agent and every MCP server, evaluating each JSON-RPC tool call against rules you control and denying dangerous requests before they reach the upstream. It does not operate at the TCP level — it inspects and gate-checks every call at L7 (the MCP protocol layer) before forwarding.

---

## What It Does

- **Detects MCP configs across 8 clients** — Automatically discovers MCP server configurations from Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code (user + workspace), ChatGPT Desktop, Codex, JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.), Windsurf, and project-local files (`.mcp.json`, `.mcp/config.json`). No manual wiring required.

- **Runtime proxy with policy enforcement** — Starts a transparent JSON-RPC 2.0 proxy on port 9420. Every tool call, resource access, and prompt request is intercepted, evaluated against your policy, and allowed, denied, warned, or redacted. Three modes: `default-deny` (zero-trust), `allowlist` (whitelist known-good), and `audit` (log only, no blocking).

- **13 built-in risk rules** — Covers shell interpreters (`bash`, `sh`, `zsh`, `python`, `node`), sandbox bypass (`--no-sandbox`, `--disable-web-security`), credential exposure in environment variables, Docker privileged containers, raw network tools (`curl`, `nc`, `telnet`), process spawning, destructive filesystem operations, remote URL access, risky package runners (`npx`, `uvx`), privilege escalation (`sudo`, `chmod`), and sensitive filesystem paths.

- **Policy engine with time-windowed rules, learning mode, rule inheritance, and context awareness** — Rules support regex pattern matching, exact-match, and substring containment. Restrict tool access by day of week and hour range (`timeWindow`). Condition rules on client identity or request rate (`contextCondition`). Policies can `extend` parent templates. The `audit` mode serves as a learning mode: run it to observe actual tool usage before switching to `enforce`.

- **Live dashboard, SARIF reports, CI/CD integration, and observatory bridge** — A real-time HTML dashboard shows request stats, block rates, connected clients, and recent blocked calls. Generate SARIF 2.1.0 reports for GitHub Code Scanning. Import security findings from [mcp-observatory](https://github.com/KryptosAI/mcp-observatory) and automatically convert them to policy rules. `mcp-seatbelt check` exits non-zero in CI when critical risks are detected.

- **Per-call timeouts** — Hung tool calls are killed and return a clean JSON-RPC error instead of a raw 503. Configurable per-rule (10s for shell commands, 60s for safe tools).

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npx mcp-seatbelt init          # scan all clients, assess risk, generate policy
npx mcp-seatbelt proxy         # start the enforcing proxy on port 9420
npx mcp-seatbelt dashboard     # view live stats at http://localhost:9421
```

On first run, `init` creates `.mcp-seatbelt/policy.yml` (your editable ruleset) and `.mcp-seatbelt/risk-report.md` (a summary of every server and its risk flags). The proxy starts in `audit` mode by default — observe actual tool usage, then switch to `enforce` when ready.

### Docker

```bash
docker run -p 9420:9420 -v $(pwd)/.mcp-seatbelt:/app/.mcp-seatbelt ghcr.io/kryptosai/mcp-seatbelt:latest proxy
```

```

- **Proxy** — Listens for inbound JSON-RPC 2.0 requests from the AI agent. Manages server registration, proxied URL routing, and connection lifecycle.
- **Policy Engine** — Evaluates each request against the loaded policy. Checks tool name, arguments, and description against rules. Returns `allow`, `deny`, `warn`, or `redact` with reasons.
- **Interceptor** — Applies the engine's decision. Allowed calls are forwarded. Denied calls receive an MCP error response. Warned calls proceed but are logged. `redact` replaces argument values matching credential patterns with `***`.
- **Transport Client** — Forwards allowed requests to the real upstream MCP server and streams responses back to the agent.

The proxy never returns a raw upstream error to the agent. If a call exceeds its timeout, the child process is killed and the agent receives a clean error message — no 503s, no hanging connections.

## Policy Reference

### CLI

```bash
mcp-seatbelt init --policy enforce     # generate an enforcing policy
mcp-seatbelt proxy --config my.yml     # start proxy with custom policy
mcp-seatbelt report --sarif           # SARIF 2.1.0 output for CI
mcp-seatbelt check                    # exit 1 if critical risks found
mcp-seatbelt diff old.yml new.yml     # compare two policy files
mcp-seatbelt import-observatory       # convert observatory findings to rules
```

### Built-in Rules (Default Policy)

| Rule | Target | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `block-shell-execution` | command | Blocks direct shell interpreter invocations (bash, sh, zsh, cmd, powershell) |
| `block-sensitive-paths` | file | Blocks filesystem writes to `/etc`, `/root`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `C:\Windows` |
| `block-credential-access` | command | Blocks tools whose descriptions mention passwords, secrets, tokens, keys |
| `redact-credentials` | command | Redacts argument values whose key names match credential patterns |
| `block-private-network` | network | Blocks HTTP requests to private/loopback address ranges |
| `block-process-execution` | process | Blocks tools that spawn child processes or evaluate code |
| `allow-filesystem-writes-business-hours` | file | Allows filesystem writes only Mon-Fri, 09:00-17:00 |

### Policy Templates

| Template | Default Action | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `minimal-workstation` | allow | Blocks shell execution and credential access only; everything else permitted |
| `pci-compliance` | deny | Blocks shell, credentials, PAN/cardholder data paths, audit log tampering |
| `strict-production` | deny | Blocks all tool calls, network requests, and filesystem operations by default |

Templates can be extended via the `extends` field in your policy file:

```yaml
version: '1'
mode: enforce
extends:
  - pci-compliance
rules:
  - id: custom-rule
    target: network
    match: pattern
    values: ['.*']
    action: deny
```

### Rule Schema

```yaml
rules:
  - id: example-rule                # unique identifier
    description: What this blocks   # human-readable explanation
    target: command                 # command | file | network | env | process
    match: pattern                  # exact | pattern | contains
    values:                         # list of strings or regex patterns
      - '^rm\s+-rf'
    action: deny                    # allow | deny | warn | redact
    timeWindow:                     # optional — restrict by day/hour
      days: [Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday]
      startHour: 9
      endHour: 17
    contextCondition:               # optional — restrict by client or rate
      clientIn: [cursor, claude-desktop]
      maxRequestsPerMinute: 60
```

### Allowlist

Entries in the allowlist bypass all deny rules. Use after running `init` to whitelist known-good tools, paths, hosts, and environment variables:

```yaml
allowlist:
  tools: [safe-tool, read-only-fs]
  paths: [/home/user/projects/]
  hosts: [api.github.com]
  envVars: [NODE_ENV, PATH]
```

## Client Integration Guide

After starting the proxy, update each client's MCP configuration to route through `localhost:9420`. The proxy prints a table of proxy URLs on startup — copy and paste them.

**Cursor** — `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "my-server": { "url": "http://localhost:9420/my-server" } } }
```

**Claude Desktop** — `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "my-server": { "url": "http://localhost:9420/my-server" } } }
```

**VS Code** — `.vscode/mcp.json` or User settings
```json
{ "servers": { "my-server": { "url": "http://localhost:9420/my-server" } } }
```

**ChatGPT Desktop** — App config
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "my-server": { "url": "http://localhost:9420/my-server" } } }
```

**Codex / JetBrains / Windsurf** — Same pattern: replace the `command`/`args` transport with `"url": "http://localhost:9420/<server-name>"`.

## Combined with mcp-observatory

[mcp-observatory](https://github.com/KryptosAI/mcp-observatory) scans MCP servers at rest — auditing source code, supply chain posture, and manifest hygiene. Seatbelt provides the runtime counterpart.

**Workflow:**

1. **Scan first** — Run mcp-observatory to audit every MCP server before installation. It produces a security findings artifact (JSON).
2. **Convert** — `mcp-seatbelt import-observatory ./observatory-results.json` converts findings into policy rules.
3. **Enforce at runtime** — The proxy loads those rules and blocks any tool call that matches an observatory finding, closing the loop from static analysis to live enforcement.

The observatory bridge (`mergeObservatoryPolicy`) can merge findings into an existing seatbelt policy without overwriting your custom rules.

---

## Enterprise

[mcp-observatory Cloud](https://observatory.anomaly.ai) provides hosted dashboards, private CI scanning, certification badges, and supply-chain compliance reports for teams and organizations. Seatbelt integrates as the runtime enforcement layer — observatory validates what you install; seatbelt controls what it can do at execution time.

- Observatory Cloud: hosted scanning, private registries, team dashboards
- Seatbelt: on-machine proxy with policy enforcement, redaction, and live monitoring
- Together: scan at rest + enforce at runtime = complete MCP security lifecycle
